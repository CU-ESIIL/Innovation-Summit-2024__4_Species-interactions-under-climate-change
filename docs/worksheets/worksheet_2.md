# TEAM ACTIVITY Day 1: Make a plan

## Instructions
Work through the prompts in order. Please use a decision-making method “to decide” before moving to a new section of the activity.  

## Day 1 Objectives
1. Get to know your group members.
2. Decide on a research question and project title.
3. Start exploring potential datasets.

## Introductions (approx. time: 10 mins total or "1-2 breaths" per prompt)
Please share the following information about yourself. Each team member should type their response in the space below (create more as needed).

## Research Question: Innovation for Inclusion or Computation (approx. time: 5-10 mins)
Write the research question your team selected in the space below. Feel free to revise the original question.

## Project Title (approx. time: 5-10 mins)
Craft a catchy title for your team’s project. Think of something that would grab attention at a conference or in a headline.

## Promoting Resilience and Adaptation
Describe how your proposed project aligns with the Summit's themes of resilience and adaptation. Please provide 1-2 sentences that clearly connect your project's goals or methods to these themes.

We sketched out how climate change (1) influences function traits/functions (2) which influences species interactions (3)

Some species interactions we discussed:
- predator-prey ints. in insects
- plant-pollinator interactions
- interspecies int. among plants
- herbivory
- seed dispersal
- cicades, plant biomass, and predators

Aspects of climate change:
- Approaches
- temporal data (lt. vs. syn)
- space for time
- time for time
- modeled
- alt. for time

Some whiteboarded topics (what is resilience):
- resilience of interactions
- network connectivity types
- species function (e.g. pollination) -> which functions are lost/retained?
- Recovery after disturbance

## Choosing Big Data Sets
Explore potential data sets for your project's topic from the [data library](https://cu-esiil.github.io/data-library/). List your options below, organizing them by whether they represent the system you're studying (e.g., deciduous forests) or the disruption to it (e.g., wildfire). Then discuss your choices and indicate your final selections.

List of data sets from 5/14:
- NEON species occurrence
- Seed dispersal data (Grant)
- Web of life (spatially explicit, spp. itneraction data)
- Globi (synthetic, timestamped)
- iNaturalist
- eBird
- LTER trove
- eltontraits
- flux towers
- pollinator types (Grant)

  - **Perturbator/Disrupter (Final Choice):**
    - [Indicate your final selected data set here]



## Brief Check-in: Definition of Resilience (approx. 5 mins)
Below is a working definition of the word "Resilience" for the Summit. Please edit the definition below based on your earlier discussion and chosen project.

*"Resilience is the capacity of a system, community, organization, or individual to absorb stress, recover from disruptions, adapt to change, and continue to develop and thrive."*

## Day 1 Report Back
Select one representative from your group to present your proposed project. For the report back, each group will have 30-60 seconds to present their responses to the questions below. Keep it concise and focused. This is just a quick oral presentation - you will not be able to use slides/images.
