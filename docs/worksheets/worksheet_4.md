# TEAM ACTIVITY 3: Share Your Progress

Use this time to prepare for the final report back, where you'll share an interesting result/outcome from your project and discuss potential future plans.

## Day 3 Report Back
Select one or more people from your group to give a final report back. You will share this page on the screen as your presentation. Presentations should be no longer than 4 minutes.

- **Project Title:**
    - Pollinating Resilient Interactions (PRI): Resilience of plant-pollinator interactions in the face of climate change
      
- **Research Question:**
    - How have California droughts affected the structure and diversity of plant-pollinator interactions?
      
- **One interesting graphic/finding:**
    - Previous research has found that droughts may increase plant-pollinator interactions by reducing pollen and nectar production, so that pollinators need to visit plants more frequently.
      
- **What are you thinking about doing next with your team? Long-term, short-term?**
    - Long-term: Working group and publication
    - Short-term: monthly or bimonthly Zoom meetings

- **Whatâ€™s missing: what resources, people, data sets, etc. does your team need?**
    - We are welcoming more collaborators and considering starting a working group. 
      - We would welcome experts in drought to join the team.
      - We are using iNaturalist image data to track plant-pollinator interaction occurrences.
      - Anyone interested in pollination networks, diversity and their resilience should reach out to mill5773@umn.edu.


### Reminder
There is the opportunity for groups to continue working on their projects as an ESIIL Working Group. If you love your team and want to continue working together, considering submitting a Working Group Application this fall. See the ESIIL website for more information: <https://esiil.org/working-groups>.

**Thank you for participating in the 2024 ESIIL Innovation Summit!!**
